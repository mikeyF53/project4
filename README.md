# Project Overview

### Code Tutor

A teaching app that helps students learn to code with repetition.

## Project Description

This app will help instructors aide in teaching students how to code. Main objective of this app is to have students learn how the code functions while they type it repeatedly with space-repetition. After an instructor uploads the code they want to teach, students are able to log on and start the exercise. Students will complete the exercise a number of times the instructor has set. Between each completion there will be a 10min break until the next exercise starts.

### `Technologies`
Rails for the server side, and React on the client.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

My MVP will be an app thats able to generate a random restaurant once the zipcode has been input. After clicking submit it will display the restaurant with all the restaurant's information. Clicking on restaurants name will link it to the yelp site for more information. If user wishes there is a restaurant list at the bottom if they want to check out other restaurants nearby.

In my Post MVP will incorporate the slackbot to run the app  and generate a place to eat along with a timer that will let students know when lunch is over. I will also add the google api to show where the nearby restaurants on the map.

#### MVP EXAMPLE

- Have users register
